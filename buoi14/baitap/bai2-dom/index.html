        JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building
        interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says.
        When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce
        web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which
        can be used to build games and communication applications that run
        directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the
        functionality of JavaScript as well. Drawbacks: Internet browsers can
        disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code
        pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. Common
        uses: JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application
        development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based
        applications, which do not require users to download an application.

        Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the
        development of client-server applications, which are used by large
        businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled
        programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can
        run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described
        as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language. Drawbacks: Java
        is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the
        server (which is common for business applications). In addition, the
        software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a licensing fee to use
        the Java Development Kit. Common uses: Along with business applications,
        Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.

        Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to
        learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and
        toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such
        as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in
        the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science
        concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular
        programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python
        skills are in high demand. Drawbacks: Python is not suitable for mobile
        application development. Common uses: Python is used in a wide variety
        of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services,
        and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are
        also built on Python.
