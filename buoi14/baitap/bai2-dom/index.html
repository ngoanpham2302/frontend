          JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building
          interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says.
          When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce
          web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which
          can be used to build games and communication applications that run
          directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the
          functionality of JavaScript as well. Drawbacks: Internet browsers can
          disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code
          pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. Common
          uses: JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application
          development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based
          applications, which do not require users to download an application.

          Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the
          development of client-server applications, which are used by large
          businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled
          programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can
          run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described
          as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language. Drawbacks:
          Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed
          to the server (which is common for business applications). In
          addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a
          licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit. Common uses: Along with
          business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile
          operating system.

          Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to
          learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and
          toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages
          such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students
          learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of
          computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build
          on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups,
          and therefore Python skills are in high demand. Drawbacks: Python is
          not suitable for mobile application development. Common uses: Python
          is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial
          intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites
          such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.
